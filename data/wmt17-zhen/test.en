Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
There was the handshake, yes.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
He's denied that emphatically.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
There is also an economic motive.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.

Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.

Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
