Yesterday, Gutacht's Mayor gave a clear answer to this question.
The system, which officially became operational yesterday, is of importance to the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junction.
This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.
Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: "Here safety comes first, it's that simple," said Arnold.
The traffic light system itself, which cost around EUR 15,000, is the "most modern system that is currently available on the market," explained Arnold.
And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts, with the new ones consuming just eight.
If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights, the top radar sensor checks the traffic status.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing from the heart, telling of the hardships of his childhood and youth.
In a collage of prose texts For his performance piece, "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze" (Summer lightning on the tip of your tongue), which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher ,creates a collage of prose texts.
On the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement: a crumpled sofa, on which cast members allude to copulating and masturbating - the eight-person ensemble work their way through the text material.
The 70-minute performance glosses over the script with a host of director's additions, well-known from the repertoire of post-dramatic theatrical styles.
However, the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery.
The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.
"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.
It was not something people wanted.
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.
Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.
An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.
Königsfeld: Small team gives a spirited performance
For the training exercise, department commander, Hans Kammerer, chose the Feder premises on Burgberger Strasse.
A short-circuit was reported to have occurred there during sawing.

Referring to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money".
Built by experts
Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel, investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year.
On 15 March, the anniversary year will be officially launched, and because Geisingen currently has no suitable venues, this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary celebrations, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.
And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed.
The Leipferdingen Nursing Home will turn 40 years old, the Geisingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May, and the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brunnenfest [Fountain Festival] from 4 to 7 July.
Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.
Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn's reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward.
According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would "bear the brunt of the cost" for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.
30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short list.

Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance
A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."

Under the management of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as untrained workers, will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three winters.
"What's innovative about it is that the six-month courses end with diplomas," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
There are many benefits: The participants will not be unemployed, the companies receive trained skilled workers, which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants, and the agency will not have to fund unemployment.

Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.
The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
On Saturday 26 October, this exceptional mass will be heard from 7.00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Marinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October, from 10.15, at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.

The majority of loudspeaker announcements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level.
Among others, the airports in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call-outs.
By doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call-outs come through the loudspeakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be calmer in future.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of, and at the same time, all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them," said Kleeman while chatting to the radio broadcaster.

UN hails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.
These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.

Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.
Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.
Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.

"We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible," said Mayor Jens Häußler, opening the citizen's information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
A river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
In expert circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
"There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvement," said Häußler.
However, Häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed.
In order to develop such a concept, the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens.
The problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken.
The town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can withstand rainfall events every two to three years.

"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.
The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.
Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.
And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.
"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at age 12.
At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.
What he found out was horrifying.

Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.
These spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.

Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.
While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.

However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
It was mainly the chants of away fans that could be heard.
And as soon as the vociferous request for "derby winners stand up" came from the south stand upon kick-off, everything was back to normal.

At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.
Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.

Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.

For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts, ice cream or a strong Edam, these indulgences are off the menu for vegans.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," said Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which applies to all their consumer behaviour.
Converting has had a positive effect for me.
"My blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis," revealed Proctor.
"Many people overlook the fact that even though ready-made vegan products are expensive, it is well-known that this is also the case for "normal" ready-made products.
When you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value.
"I do not disapprove of people, I am part of this society," said Proctor, explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation.
However, purchasing vegan products can be difficult to start with.

When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.
Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.

I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.
Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.
I've reached a point of political despair.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.

In the B Class, two teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.

Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
There are a lot of patients.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.
In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.
The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.
It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.

The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre, right at the cathedral.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall.
The next stop on the tour is the praetorium, where participants once again descend to the depths.

Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.
